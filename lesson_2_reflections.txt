1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Initializing a repository puts a hidden .git folder into the directory. This folder stores important metadata
	which git uses for all of its special functions. An initial commit is not created, however.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area is an intermediary between the two. The working directory is what you're directly
	interacting with and the repository is what git interacts with. Rather than chucking everything into the repository
	willy-nilly, git gives the option of setting it all up in the staging area first so you can be specific
	about what you want to commit, how, and when.
