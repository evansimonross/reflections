1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	- When you're working on a solo project and want to keep a backup in the cloud
	- When you're working on a solo project from multiple devices
	- When you're working on a colaborative project

2. Why might you want to always pull manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Some commits performed locally may not be ready for publishing to the public. For example, after merging
	a new feature into the master branch, you'd need to commit right away, but you probably want to 
	take some time to check for bugs before publishing your project with that new feature included.
